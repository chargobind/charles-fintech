# <H1> Case Study

## <H2> Overview and Origin

# Freshbook

 - When was the company incorporated? 2002

 - Who are the founders of the company? Mike McDerment

 - How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? Mike accidentally saved over an old invoice. Knowing there had to be a better way, Mike decided to create it himself. Over the next two weeks, he coded up a solution that became the foundation of what is now FreshBooks.

 -  How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? The company is funded by many institutional investors/VCs/PEs through seed rounds. Investors include, JP Morgan Chase, Georgian Partners, Northlead Capital Partners, Accomplice. Currently the total funding secured is 75.1MM through Series A/B/Corporate/PE rounds.


## <H2> Business Activities:

- What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? Accounting/Billing

-  Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? designer, marketing agencies, plumbers, IT professionals, lawyers, architects,  web professionals, etc.  Market Size of set customers is unlimited given the reach to self-employed individuals

-  What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) At the time, the major competitor was QuickBooks, which geared towards the accountants and firms. So FreshBooks’ strategy was to focus on a segment of end users who are not accounting professionals but would benefit from an intuitive accounting software platform, specifically the web designers. By focusing on that one vertical, Freshbooks was able to establish itself and become the domain expert. Even when they gained traction, they continued to focus on this vertical and avoid temptations for a long time by new verticals before they get pulled into other verticals much later on. In addition, Freshbooks purposely stayed within North America to make sure that it could benefit from compounded brand awareness value and ensure the consistency of customer feedback. Expansion into other parts of the world such as Australia would mean that Freshbooks has to deal with another set of tax code, which would bring about a short term boost in user numbers in the short run but a loss of focus in the long run that will compromise the quality of their product.

Mike stressed the importance of maintaining focus in dealing with this challenge. From the get go, Freshbooks entered into a market that didn’t have a lot of competition and figured out a focused and unique approach to marketing that does not mimic its competitors.

3 Key Takeaways from Mike McDerment
Presenter: Zihao Jiang

Lesson 1 : Start with the Customer & Work Backwards

Customer proximity is the key reason Freshbooks enjoys ongoing success. When trying to build a product around the customer and drive differentiated value, Mike found that it’s critical to thoroughly understand the customers and their pain-points. For example, in order to foster this customer-oriented culture, new hires of Freshbooks always start off by spending a month in customer service to truly understand the product, customer, and culture of Freshbooks. 

Mike also emphasized the importance of getting feedback from end consumers directly to collect data in order to establish product-market fit and gain the competitive advantage over other firms. To further demonstrate their customer focus, FreshBooks built an online blog page “where small business owners learn to thrive”. By building this small space, the firm is able to qualify their target audience and enable their customers to evolve with their product. Contents shared in the blog often sparks discussions about the product features and customer pain-points, which gives FreshBooks the opportunity to identify common problems their customers are facing so they are able to address immediately and effectively. 

Lesson 2: The Recurring Theme of the Power of Focus 

The challenge of having SMBs as target customers is that SMBs are not as deep-pocketed as large enterprises and they are highly price sensitive. Mike stressed the importance of maintaining focus in dealing with this challenge. From the get go, Freshbooks entered into a market that didn’t have a lot of competition and figured out a focused and unique approach to marketing that does not mimic its competitors. 

At the time, the major competitor was QuickBooks, which geared towards the accountants and firms. So FreshBooks’ strategy was to focus on a segment of end users who are not accounting professionals but would benefit from an intuitive accounting software platform, specifically the web designers. By focusing on that one vertical, Freshbooks was able to establish itself and become the domain expert. Even when they gained traction, they continued to focus on this vertical and avoid temptations for a long time by new verticals before they get pulled into other verticals much later on. In addition, Freshbooks purposely stayed within North America to make sure that it could benefit from compounded brand awareness value and ensure the consistency of customer feedback. Expansion into other parts of the world such as Australia would mean that Freshbooks has to deal with another set of tax code, which would bring about a short term boost in user numbers in the short run but a loss of focus in the long run that will compromise the quality of their product. 

Lesson 3: Be a preemptive innovator - don’t wait until the “platform is burning” to take a leap into the right direction 

To build the best product in the market, it is incredibly important to have awareness and humility about your strengths and weaknesses. This will enable you to surround yourself with the right kind of team members that can augment your skills and, when empowered, will help take your vision to new and greater heights.

The Bill Spring Experiment is a unique example of how Mike successfully created a sense of urgency within his organization, enabling FreshBooks to overcome the limitations that were manifesting from their legacy platform. Mike acknowledged this as a common problem among big companies, as they fear innovation and the potential disruption it will have on already successful products. What Mike did, which other leaders fail to do, is empowering his team members to experiment with creating a new platform. He acknowledged that he did not initially understand the product approach and recognized himself as a barrier. This type of self-awareness is tied to his visionary and inspiring leadership style, which led to the creation of Bill Spring - a competitor company that was built by FreshBooks employees to test out their new platform directly with customers without tarnishing the FreshBooks reputation. Bill Spring served as a petri dish for innovation, where employees could take enormous risk and not fear repercussion. 

When Freshbooks decided to move the customers over to the Bill Spring platform, they let the customers migrate with the click of a button and reverse-migrate back without losing any information. The ability to rollback is very important for some business whose process is entrenched to the old platform. This is another example of Freshbook’s customer-oriented approach.

In the end, Bill Spring not only proved out the new FreshBooks platform but also led to the development of internal Lean Product management processes and techniques that they still use to date.
